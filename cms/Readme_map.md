# About
As of the 1999 field season, 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) are collecting climate information on Greenland's ice sheet. Each AWS is equipped with a number of instruments to sample the following:

- air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, pressure
- accumulation rate at high temporal resolution to identify and resolve individual storms
- surface radiation balance in visible and infrared wavelengths
- sensible and latent heat flux fluxes
- snowpack conductive heat fluxes

# Implementation
The file map.php reads data from the JSON File Resources/Public/JavaScript/stations.json and displays the automated weather stations AWS in greenland. 
Visualization is donw with AM Charts and a proper licence.

Overview of stations can only be found here: https://www.wsl.ch/gcnet/stations

No localization implemented
